## 1. Overview

In Week 2 we are learning about C++ libraries and this assignment is your chance to practise those
skills.

Now that you’ve been introduced to the C++ Standard Library, it’s time to put that knowledge to use.
In the role of client, the low-level details have already been dealt with, and you can focus your
attention on solving more pressing problems. Having a library of thoroughly tested and reviewed
types designed by field experts vastly broadens the kinds of tasks you can “easily” tackle. In this
first assignment, you’ll write the back-end for a program that heavily leverages the Standard
Library to do nifty things. It might sound a little daunting at first; but given the power tools in
your arsenal, you can focus on solving the problem at hand, instead of worrying about how to
implement everything from scratch. Let’s hear it for well-designed code!

This assignment has several purposes:

1. To explore C++’s value semantics.
2. To stress the notion of modularity as a mechanism for managing data and providing functionality
   without revealing the implementation.
3. To become more familiar with C++'s type system.
4. To gain familiarity with the C++ Standard Library.

Leveraging `std::vector`, `std::queue`, and `std::unordered_set` are critical for writing a
word ladder builder. A word ladder is a connection from one word to another, formed by changing one
letter at a time, with the constraint that each transformation yields a new valid word. For example,
here is a word ladder connecting "code" to "data".

```txt
code -> cade -> cate -> date -> data
```

Many word ladders will have multiple solutions, such as connecting "work" to "play".

```txt
work fork form foam flam flay play
work pork perk peak pean plan play
work pork perk peak peat plat play
work pork perk pert peat plat play
work pork porn pirn pian plan play
work pork port pert peat plat play
work word wood pood plod ploy play
work worm form foam flam flay play
work worn porn pirn pian plan play
work wort bort boat blat plat play
work wort port pert peat plat play
work wort wert pert peat plat play
```

The back-end that you will write takes a start word, a destination word, and a lexicon, and returns a vector of valid word ladders. By using [breadth-first search][bfs], you’re guaranteed to find the
shortest such sequence. Here are some more examples.

```cpp
word_ladder::generate("awake", "sleep", english_words);
// returns {
//   {"awake","aware","sware","share","sharn","shawn","shewn","sheen","sheep","sleep"}
//   {"awake","aware","sware","share","shire","shirr","shier","sheer","sheep","sleep"}
// }
word_ladder::generate("airplane", "tricycle", engish_words);
// returns {}
```

## 2. Understanding a Word Ladder Implementation

Finding a word ladder is a specific instance of a [shortest-path problem][ssp], where the challenge
is to find the shortest path from a starting position to a goal. Shortest-path problems come up in a
variety of situations, such as packet routing, robot motion planning, social networks, and studying
gene mutations. One approach for finding a shortest path is the classic breadth-first search
algorithm. A breadth-first search searches outward from the start in a radial fashion, until it hits
the goal. For our word ladder, this means examining those ladders that represent one hop from the
start. A “hop” is a change in letter. One “hop” from the start means one changed letter, two “hops”
means two changed letters, and so on. It’s possible for the same position in a word to have letter changes
across multiple non-adjacent hops. If any of these reach the destination, we’re done. If not, the
search now examines all the ladders that add one more hop. By expanding the search at each step, all
one-hop ladders are examined before two-hop ladders, and three-hop ladders are only taken into
consideration if none of the one-hop or two-hop ladders work out; thus the algorithm is guaranteed
to find the shortest successful ladder.

Breadth-first searches are typically implemented using a queue. The queue stores partial ladders
that represent possibilities to explore. The ladders are enqueued in order of increasing length. The
first elements enqueued are all the one-hop ladders, followed by the two-hop ladders, and so on. Due
to FIFO handling, ladders will be dequeued in order of increasing length. The algorithm operates by
dequeuing the front ladder from the queue and determining if it reaches the goal. If it does, then
you have a complete ladder, and it is the shortest. If not, you take that partial ladder and extend
it to reach words that are one more hop away, and enqueue those ladders onto the queue, to be
examined later. If you exhaust the queue of possibilities without having found a completed ladder,
you can conclude that no ladder exists.

A few of these tasks deserve a bit more explanation. For example, you’ll need to find all the _valid_ words
that differ by one letter from a given word. You might reach for a raw loop to change each letter to
all the other letters in the alphabet. You may try something more targetted. Either way, repeat this for each letter position in the word and you will have discovered all the words that are one letter away.

Another, more subtle issue, is the restriction that you shouldn’t reuse words that have been
included in a previous ladder. This is an optimisation that avoids exploring redundant paths. For
example, if you previously tried the ladder `cat->cot->cog` and are now processing `cat->cot->con`,
you would find that the word `cog` is one letter away from `con`, which looks like a potential
candidate to extend this ladder. However, `cog` has already been reached in an earlier (and thus
shorter) ladder, so there is no point in reconsidering it in a longer ladder. The simplest way to
ensure this is to keep track of the words that have been used in any ladder, and ignore them when
they resurface. This is also necessary to avoid getting trapped in circular, non-terminating ladders
such as `cat->cot->cog->bog->bat->cat`. Since you need linear access to all of the items in a
word ladder when time comes to return it, it makes sense to model an individual word ladder using
`std::vector<std::string>`. Remember that because C++ has value semantics, you’re able to copy
vectors via copy construction (e.g. `auto word_ladder_clone = word_ladder;`) and copy assignment
(e.g. `word_ladder_clone = word_ladder`).

**If there are multiple shortest paths, your implementation must return all the solutions, sorted in
lexicographical (alphabetical) order. Thus, the return type for your word ladder generator will be
`std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>`.**

## 3. The Task

This generator might seem like it’s a panacea, but it still benefits from a step-by-step development
plan to keep things moving along.

* **Task 1** --- _Familiarise yourself with the libraries available._ You don’t need to deep-dive,
but it would be a smart idea to read up on `std::vector`, `std::queue`, and `std::unordered_set`,
from the standard library. You shouldn’t worry about their implementation details: focus on the interfaces, and how you use them in practice.
* **Task 2** --- _Test design._ We’ve provided you with a very simple test case to show you how to
use the test library. You should add more `TEST_CASE`s underneath, so you have a suite of checks to
make sure you catch any logic errors in your generator. We adopt Google’s Beyoncé rule in this
class: “if you liked it, you should have put a test on it”. Test words that are short (one or two
letters) and test words that are longer.
* **Task 3** --- _Design your algorithm._ Be sure you understand the breadth-first search algorithm
on paper, and what types you will need to use.
* **Task 4** --- _Lexicon handling._ Set up an `std::unordered_set` object with the large lexicon,
read from a data file. There’s a utility function called `word_ladder::read_lexicon` that you will also need to implement. If you find yourself struggling to write `word_ladder::generate()`, it may be helpful to take a break by implementing an easier function.
* **Task 5** --- _Write `generate`._ With your design in hand from Task 3, you can rough out an implementation of `generate()` and progressively improve it as you understand the problem and optimise more and more.

### 3.1. Assumptions

* You can assume that the start word and end word have the same length (i.e. number of characters).
* You can assume that both the start and the end word are in the lexicon.
* You can assume the start word and the end word will not be the same word.
* You can assume that `word_ladder::read_lexicon` will always be given path to a valid file in the correct format

### 3.2. Implementation hints

Again, it’s all about leveraging the libraries at your disposal --- you’ll find your job is just to
coordinate the activities of your objects to do the search.

* [`std::vector`][vector] maintains a contiguous sequence of elements, and has random access.
  Benchmarks have shown that its contiguous storage makes it the fastest and smallest container
  in many situations (even when computer science theory tells us that a linked list would be
  better!).
* [`std::queue`][queue] offers a FIFO interface over a container, which is probably what you’ll
  want to use for tracking your partial ladders. Ladders are enqueued (and thus dequeued) in
  order of length, so as to find the shortest option first.
* [`std::unordered_set`][us] (note 1) is the hash-set that we use for the input lexicon, and is
  recommended for any internal lexicons you might use.
* [Algorithms] and ranges are powerful tools for describing what you want your program to do.
* As a minor detail, it doesn’t matter if the start and destination words are contained in the
  lexicon or not. You can eliminate non-words from the get-go or just allow them to fall through and
  be searched anyway. During marking, the start and destination words will always be taken from the
  lexicon.

## 4. Getting Started

If you haven't done so already, clone this repository.

```sh
$ git clone gitlab@gitlab.cse.unsw.edu.au:COMP6771/24T2/students/z5555555/ass1.git
```

(Note: Replace z5555555 with your zid)

Most of the files here will be quite familiar to you. But there are key files in the `src` directory:

* `english.txt`: The file where the lexicon is.
* `main.cpp`: The file where a main function exists for debugging.
* `word_ladder.cpp`: The library file that has the word ladder generator function.
* `word_ladder.h`: The header file for the word ladder generator library file.
* `word_ladder_test.cpp`: The test file where you can write tests to help debug your code.
* `word_ladder_benchmark.cpp`: A test file to help you understand how you're performing with the hardest test.

### 4.1. Setup

Remember, since we just cloned, we will need to run `cmake -B build` to configure the makefile.

### 4.2. Running the tests

Now that we've configured cmake, we can navigate to `build` and run:

```sh
$ make
$ ctest
```

This will show you the output from your tests.

### 4.3. Adding more tests

Part of your assignment mark will come from the quality and extensiveness of tests that you write.

You can add more tests to `src/word_ladder.test.cpp`. You are not allowed to add any new files.

You should consider the order of how your tests are run: they are executed in order from the top of the file to the bottom. Likewise, it doesn't make sense to test properties of your algorithm that logically rely on prior testable facts to be true. E.g., it makes more sense to test your code does the right thing for when there's no word ladders between two words versus one or more.

### 4.4. Measuring your performance

There is a **12 second time limit** per test that we will enforce when marking your assignment. For the average student, this means that some of the hardest test cases may not run fast enough with your algorithm and you may fail the latter tests due to timeout.

We have provided the hardest test case we will test against in `src/word_ladder_benchmark.test.cpp`.
If you can successfully pass this test within 12 seconds **ON THE CSE MACHINES** then we are providing
you a guarantee that you will not fail those tests from a timeout. If you exceed 12 seconds for that
test, you may still get the marks, but it's just something we can't guarantee.

Please note: This benchmark test is VERY difficult. If your code takes an hour to run this test that's
not something that should make you panic. It's quite easy to fall in the time limit for most of the
tests. Don't stress and just make sure earlier tests fall in the 12 second time limit on CSE
machines.

To measure your performance:

1. Make sure you change CMake to build in `[Release]` mode by running `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build` in the project directory.
   This will remove debug symbols and other things, which will mean your code runs faster, but is
   near impossible to debug for mere mortals. This is usually what is done when you're finished
   developing and ready for release.

2. In the `build` folder, build with `make word_ladder_benchmark_exe` and run `time ./word_ladder_benchmark` to run the benchmark. It
   will output something like this below. The time you should measure yourself against is the "user"
   time. If this is under 12 seconds then you're all good.

```txt
real    1m45.089s
user    1m44.497s
sys     0m0.560s
```

3. Once you are happy with your performance, don't forget to change CMake back to `[Debug]` by running `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -B build` in the project directory. This will add back debug symbols in so that you can more effectively debug your code.

### 4.5. Compiling with main.cpp

We have provided a `main.cpp` file that you can use a scratchpad and informal place to test your code. This is a great place to start and to debug, but as your program develops you should be relying on running tests.

Remember, to compile your main function you simply run `make debugging` followed by running `./debugging` in the `build` folder.

## 5. Marking Criteria

This assignment will contribute 15% to your final mark.

The assessment for the assignment recognises the difficulty of the task, the importance of style,
and the importance of appropriate use of programming methods (e.g. using while loops instead of a
dozen if statements).

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
  <tr>
    <td align=right>50%</td>
    <td>
      <b>Correctness</b><br />
      The correctness of your program will be determined automatically by tests that we will run against
      your program. You will not know the full sample of tests used prior to marking. Your program must
      also find the word ladder(s) for a given input in the time limit specified above.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align=right>25%</td>
    <td>
      <b>Your tests</b><br />
      You are required to write your own tests to ensure your program works.
      You will write tests in the <code>word_ladder.test.cpp</code> file. Please read the <a href="https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md">Catch2 tutorial</a> or review lecture/lab content to see how to write tests. Tests will be marked on several
      factors. These include, <em>but are not limited to</em>:
      <ul>
        <li>Correctness — an incorrect test is worse than useless.</li>
        <li>
          Coverage - your tests might be great, but if they don't cover the part that ends up
          failing, they weren't much good to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Brittleness — If you change your implementation, will the tests need to be changed (this
          generally means avoiding calling functions specific to your implementation where possible
          - ones that would be private if you were doing OOP).
        </li>
        <li>
          Clarity — If your test case failed, it should be immediately obvious what went wrong (this
          means splitting it up into appropriately sized sub-tests, amongst other things).
        </li>
      </ul>
      At least half of the marks of this section may be awarded with the expectation that your own tests pass your own code.

      <b>C++ Style & Best Practices</b><br />
      Your adherence to good C++ best practices as shown in lectures and as documented on the coure website.
      This is based on how well you use modern C++ methodologies taught in this course as opposed to using
      backwards-compatible C methods.
      This section will also include marks for how well you follow general best porgramming practices, including maintaining
      small functions, reducing nesting in loops, having meaningful variable names, etc.

</table>

Please note: Significant penalties may apply if you do not comply with the 'Git Commit Requirements' requirements as described in section 6 below.

## 6. Git Commit Requirements

It's imperative that we are able to track your progress when marking.

For assignment 1, there are some requirements for us to track your ongoing progress:

1. You must make commits on at least 3 unique days prior to due date.
2. All of your commits to master must successfully compile (according to the pipeline). You are given 3 exceptions.
3. Your commits must be meaningful in description (e.g. "Continued work on loop speed")
4. Each commit include no more than 50 lines additions of code (this may differ in future assignments). You are given no exceptions.

Failure to adhere to these guidelines in their entirety may result in a mimumum 20% penalty. Any moderate or significant failure may result in a 0 grade.

Please note: If you choose to work on separate branches before merging into master, you must squash your commits when merging back in. This means that you can make many commits on other branches fine, it's just whatever comes back to master needs to be a single commit that compiles with no more than 50 line additions.

## 7. Originality of Work

The work you submit must be your own work.  Submission of work partially or completely derived from
any other person or jointly written with any other person is not permitted.

The penalties for such an offence may include negative marks, automatic failure of the course and
possibly other academic discipline. Assignment submissions will be examined both automatically and
manually for such submissions.

Relevant scholarship authorities will be informed if students holding scholarships are involved in
an incident of plagiarism or other misconduct.

Do not provide or show your assignment work to any other person &mdash; apart from the teaching
staff of COMP6771.

If you knowingly provide or show your assignment work to another person for any reason, and work
derived from it is submitted, you may be penalised, even if the work was submitted without your
knowledge or consent.  This may apply even if your work is submitted by a third party unknown to
you.

Every time you make commits or pushes on this repository, you are acknowledging that the work you
submit is your own work (as described above).

Note you will not be penalised if your work has the potential to be taken without your consent or
knowledge.

**PLEASE NOTE: We have a record of ALL previous submissions of this assignment submitted. If you find a solution from a friend, or online, we will find it and you will receive 0 for the assignment and potentially 0 for the course.** Trust me, at least 1 person does it every term and I encourage you not to think you'll get lucky.

## 8. Dryrun

If you want to check if you've actually not totally screwed it all up, and see if they pass a very basic compilation example, then run this command on the CSE systems.

`6771 dryrun ass1`

## 9. Submission

This assignment is due _Friday 14th of June, 19:59:59_.

To submit your assignment, you must ensure you've pushed all of your code to your gitlab master branch. You can check if you've done this properly by seeing what code is on the gitlab site on your master branch.

We will collect the latest work on your master branch of gitlab at the time of submission.

It is your responsibiltiy to ensure that your code can run successfully on a CSE machine / VLAB when cloned fresh from Gitlab.

## 10. Late Submission Policy

Late submissions are not accepted, except in the case of ELS adjustment or Special Consideration approval.

## 11. Appendix

* (note 1) You’ll need to consult the lexicon to see if the transformation is a valid word in either
  case.
