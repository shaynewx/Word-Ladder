# Word Ladder Library

A C++ library for generating word ladders, demonstrating the use of C++ Standard Library containers and algorithms.

## Overview

This library provides a back-end for generating word laddersâ€”a sequence of words connecting two given words by changing one letter at a time, with each intermediate word being valid. The shortest path from the start word to the destination word is guaranteed using the breadth-first search algorithm.

### What is a Word Ladder?

A word ladder connects one word to another by altering one letter at a time, ensuring each intermediate step is a valid word. For example, a word ladder from "code" to "data" could look like:

```
code -> cade -> cate -> date -> data
```

The library ensures all possible shortest paths are found and returned in lexicographical order.

### Features

- Utilizes C++ Standard Library containers such as `std::vector`, `std::queue`, and `std::unordered_set`.
- Implements breadth-first search to find the shortest word ladder between two words.
- Supports large lexicons and provides efficient search and manipulation of word ladders.

## Installation

To include the Word Ladder library in your project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:shaynewx/Word-Ladder.git
    ```
2. Include the library files in your project:
    - `src/word_ladder.h`
    - `src/word_ladder.cpp`

3. Compile your project using a C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later.

## Usage

Include the header file in your source file and use the provided functions to generate word ladders:

```cpp
#include "word_ladder.h"

int main() {
    auto lexicon = word_ladder::read_lexicon("path/to/lexicon.txt");
    auto ladders = word_ladder::generate("start", "end", lexicon);

    for (const auto& ladder : ladders) {
        for (const auto& word : ladder) {
            std::cout << word << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Functionality

### `word_ladder::generate`

Generates all shortest word ladders between a start word and an end word.

- **Parameters:**
    - `const std::string& start`: The starting word.
    - `const std::string& end`: The destination word.
    - `const std::unordered_set<std::string>& lexicon`: A set of valid words.

- **Returns:** `std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>` - A vector of word ladders, each represented as a vector of strings.

### `word_ladder::read_lexicon`

Reads a lexicon from a file.

- **Parameters:**
    - `const std::string& path`: The path to the lexicon file.

- **Returns:** `std::unordered_set<std::string>` - A set of valid words.

## Testing

Unit tests are provided in `word_ladder_test.cpp` to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the library. To run the tests:

1. Configure your project with CMake in the root directory:
    ```sh
    cmake -B build
    ```
2. Build the project:
    ```sh
    cd build
    make
    ```
3. Run the tests:
    ```sh
    ctest
    ```

## Benchmarking

The library includes a benchmark utility to test performance with large datasets. To run the benchmark:

1. Compile in Release mode for optimal performance:
    ```sh
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build
    cd build
    make word_ladder_benchmark_exe
    ```
2. Execute the benchmark:
    ```sh
    ./word_ladder_benchmark
    ```
